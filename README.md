The "Rock, Paper, Scissors Game" project in Python is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer. The GUI presents buttons for the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects its move.
