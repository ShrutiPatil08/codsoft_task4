The "Rock, Paper, Scissors Game" project in Python is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer. The GUI presents buttons for the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects its move.  After both choices are made, the winner is determined based on the game's rules: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock. The application provides an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience, simulating the popular hand game between the user and the computer.
